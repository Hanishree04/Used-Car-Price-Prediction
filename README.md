## Used Car Price Prediction App

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that predicts the selling price of a used car based on user input features such as brand, fuel type, engine specs, and more. The machine learning model was trained using a Jupyter Notebook (`CAR.ipynb`) and saved as `model.pkl`.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict resale price of used cars using regression
- **Model Type**: Supervised Learning (Regression)
- **Frontend**: Streamlit Web App (`main.py`)
- **Model Training**: Jupyter Notebook (`CAR.ipynb`)
- **Deployment**: Local using Streamlit
